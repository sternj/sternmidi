# Completed this week:
Found library for interfacing arduino with MIDI
Found software for mounting arduino as USB-MIDI device
Created program demonstrating functionality of both of these

# Plan for next week:
In-depth research on bit- and byte-level of MIDI protocols
Prepare presentation on the former
Set up github repo as per specification, invite you as collaborator
Read USB controller firmware
Create multi-control USB-MIDI device
Figure out how to get Arduino Due

# Blockers:
Lack of other digital electronics equipment (i.e. potentiometers, buttons)
