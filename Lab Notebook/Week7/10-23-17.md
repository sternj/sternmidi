Over the past three days, I have been doing final testing on the components and 
designing the case. Today, I got the designs finalized and started 
printing the case. It should be done by tomorrow morning (October 14th). After
it is printed, I will mount the faceplate onto the case and stabilize
all of the wiring.


Additionally, I have completed the most complex component of the 
synthesizer patchbay, the 4-step sequencer. It took an hour or so
of tinkering, but I managed to string together a bunch of envelope
generators to make a workable solution. I have the settings dialed in,
now I just have to throw in some filters. 


Finally, I have installed the Juice development kit under an educational
license and I have started looking through it. As it turns out, the API
is written for C++, a language that I don't yet know, though
it should take no more than a few days to learn. I am working
through some of the tutorials online currently.
