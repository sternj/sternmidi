Over the past two days, I completed the soldering and mounting of components onto the faceplate. I also wrote a program to send 
control messages on any of the components being utilized. I am in the process of testing out all of the components to verify
that the soldered joints hold and all map to the proper locations. Preliminarily, it seems like everything is working fine. However, to 
really discern this we will have to fully connect everything to the Arduino.


Today was my meeting with Pito so here are some
# Goals for the week
- Begin working with Roli's Juice API
- Print the bottom of the case for the controller
- Prepare a performance of "Everything Ends Here" using my controller
- Mount the controller's faceplate and internal wiring to the newly-printed case
- Install program and new firmware onto Arduino
- Perform "Everything Ends Here"


## Completed this week
- Finished constructing and wiring the faceplate for the MIDI controller
- Wrote program to utilize it
