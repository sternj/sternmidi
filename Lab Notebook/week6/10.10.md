Finished removing parts from the soldered breadboard and beginning to put them into the solderless breadboard. The pulldown circuits are
complete and I'm beginning to  solder the buttons. Switches and LEDs have been mounted to the faceplate, some issues with
the nuts on the switches and I had to replace and re-splice a few LEDs, but all has been working so far. I extended some wires to be able to reach
the breadboard. I also mounted some smaller solderless breadboards to make more efficient +5v and Ground busses.
