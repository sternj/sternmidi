# October 11th and 12th

Finished mounting and soldering buttons and switches. There was some inconsistency in how I bussed the power, especially with wire colors
(having run out of black wiring), but through testing I eliminated any confusion that I had. I was also able to hook all of the buttons into the 
pulldown circuits.


I also soldered on and mounted all of the potentiometers. There was, however, some confusion that I had over the orientation of the wires. I had to
resolder them a number of times. The wires I attached to the variable-resistance pole were also far too short, necessitating me to 
spend about a half hour extending and securing them. The next step is testing to ensure that all of the circuits are working as intended.
