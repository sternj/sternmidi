# Accomplished this week
- Buttons on initial MIDI controller working stably
- Researched using DC motors with Arduino
# Goals for next week
- Implement 8-bit-depth control over position of motorized fader with 10k ohm resistor and DC motor
## Stretch Goals
- Begin/finish soldering completed controller onto soldered breadboard
- Begin prototyping case for final organ controllere
- Figure out how to power motors without burning out arduino
# Deliverables for next week
- A fader controlled via arduino, with the ability to read from the serial monitor a value between 0 and 127 and go to the specified positon.
