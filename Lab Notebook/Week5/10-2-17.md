Today I have spent about the past 3-odd hours working on the final prototyping for the preliminary deliverable, the MIDI controller. In this folder are going to be images of progress
in each step, including images from last week. This has proven far more labor-intensive than I anticipated, eating up many hours. 
By Wednesday, I must have at least all of the wiring done, even though the case likely will not be finished by then due to logistical issues. 


Most difficult has been the soldering, though I have run into few unanticipated issues. It just takes a long time. Currently I have the 5 circuits for the toggle switches, next I will have the 3 pull-down circuits for the buttons. Last will be the potentiometers, which should prove incredibly simple.
