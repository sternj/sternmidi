# This week
I made further progress on the soldered circuit board. However, as I mentioned earlier, I ran in to a number of issues, the main one being
the mess of wires that protruded from it. It was a mess, to say the least. Pictures are in the folder detailing that branch of this project. 
Upon talking to Pito, I decided to migrate from a soldered board to a solderless breadboard. This was a total of between 7 and 10 hours
of work to no end


I designed the faceplate for the prototype synth controller, it was printed out. All components fit perfectly and I am quickly moving to mounting
them. In my daisy-chain of LEDs hooked up to the toggle switches, I burned a few out by putting 5 volts over them.


Goals for next week
- Finish migration to solderless breadboard
- Mount all components to faceplate
- Use Tasssman to create a synthesizer to control using my control surface


Long-term goals that I am working on
- Controlling servo-potentiometers using Arduino Due
- Contacting Roli

Further long-term goals currently in queue (but aren't being worked on)
- Learning JUICE API
