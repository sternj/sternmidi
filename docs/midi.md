# What is MIDI?
MIDI is a layer-6 standard for serial communication developed in 1983. It was developed in part as a natural extension of the control voltage communication of modular synthesizers of the 1960s-70s. There were a few issues with these.

The most obvious one is that these cables take up massive amounts of space and can get messy very quickly. This is because each one can only carry a single signal, limiting its usefulness.


The second one is that there absolutely **had** to be a better way for two devices to communicate than through a massive chunk of wires. Using voltage control to make instruments communicate made sense when the main users of synthesizers were art musicians,
