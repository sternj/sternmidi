# Week 1
Contains an Arduino sketch of a simple MIDI interfacing program. A note that this must be used with the Hairless MIDI Serial Bridge to function properly. The goal of this was to usefully implement the [Arduino MIDI Library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library) in a live environment.
